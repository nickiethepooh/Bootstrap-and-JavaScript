# Bootstrap-and-JavaScript
In this project, I recreated the original assignment website for The Woodshop, the event center I run. I primarily used Bootstrap to build a responsive, user-friendly interface. The site features a navigation bar for easy access to each page. On the Home page, I included a hero banner and Bootstrap cards showcasing example events, each linking to the Events page. The Events page includes a carousel with photos of our event space and a list of event types we can host. On the Pricing page, I used a Bootstrap table to clearly present our pricing information. Lastly, the Contact page includes a client inquiry form and an accordion section with answers to frequently asked questions.
In addition to building the site, I wrote several JavaScript functions to simulate future interactive features. These include a function to change the page title dynamically, a basic addition calculator, an age check for event entry eligibility, and a guest greeting loop that uses arrays and strings. These functions are not connected to the HTML yet but demonstrate how I might add interactivity to the site later.
